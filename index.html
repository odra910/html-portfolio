<h1>The Best Movies According to Alexandra</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Trolls</h3>
<p>Great songs, valid themes on the outlook on life being worse than reality; <br/> Branch fearing danger, and Poppy having no sense of danger.</p>
<h3>Princess Mononoki</h3>
<p>Great story line about anger and the destruction of nature, beautiful <br /> artwork that makes you long for a retreat into nature, but also in awe <br /> of things greater than you, like the giant boar. </p>
<h3>Sky High</h3>
<P>Cute story line about having to live in your parents shadow of greatness <br />
     and making it your own way and discovering the greatness you have <br />
     in you thanks to your parents.
